## What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

I think data scientists try to extract insights from the data. They need to be good at both statistics and programing. They have more 
responsibility to analyze data and help company make a decision. 

## What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

When the amount of data is massive, data scientists are using modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model. 
They compare a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model. They scrape, grab, read, and manipulate data.
They combine data sources and summarize data. They apply analysis methods and communicate Effectively.

## What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 

They have something similar, like both of them focus on data collection and analysize. However, the data scientists need both statistics 
and programing knowledge. 

For statisticians, they use smaller scale methods of the data collection, and the data is verified to determine 
whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. They improve a single, simple model to best fit the data, and tend to focus 
more on quanityfying uncertainty than data scientists.  

For data scientists, they deal with massive data, and use modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model. They 
need to know more knowledge about developing algoriths, like the machine learning engineer. Ath the same time, they have the traditional 
statistics theory to extract insights from the data.

## How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

For my background, maybe I know more about traditional statistics, but I know it's not enough at this time. I need to learn more programing, 
machine learning and algorithms, but I also need to know the statistics theory behind the algorithms.
