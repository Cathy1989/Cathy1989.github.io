# My second blog post

## what was the purpose of the [project1](file:///Users/cathy/Desktop/558/project%201/project-1.html)

We practiced what we learned last week. 
First, we manipulated and processed datasets with using R packages and writing different R functions, so the datasets come in a certain form.
Then we’ll combine some parsed data and deal with it from there.
## what did you learn
I learned how to read in one of these .csv files and parse the data using functions we’ve written.
## what is the most difficult part of the [project1](file:///Users/cathy/Desktop/558/project%201/project-1.html)
Even though I know which functions to use and spent a lot of time to google how to use them, I still can't use the function very well.
