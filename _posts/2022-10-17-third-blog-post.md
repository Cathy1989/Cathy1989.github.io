## Describe the strategy you use for EDA:

1. Plotting the raw data such as data traces, histograms, bihistograms, probability plots, lag plots, block plots, and Youden plots.
2. Plotting simple statistics such as mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots of the raw data.
3. Positioning such plots so as to maximize our natural pattern-recognition abilities, such as using multiple plots per page.

##  What is your overall goal when doing an EDA? 
The purpose of Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, 
often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it 
easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model 
fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.

## What methods do you think are important? 

1. Typical graphical techniques used in EDA, like Box plot, Histogram, etc.

2. Dimensionality reduction: Multidimensional scaling, Principal component analysis (PCA), etc.

3. Typical quantitative techniques are: Median polish, Trimean, etc.

4. Specific statistical functions and techniques you can perform with EDA tools include:

* Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
* Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.
* Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the 
  target variable you’re looking at.
* Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.
* K-means Clustering is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data points are assigned into K groups, i.e. the number of clusters,
  based on the distance from each group’s centroid. The data points closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category. 
  K-means Clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.
* Predictive models, such as linear regression, use statistics and data to predict outcomes.

## What things do you try to look for? 

The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better 
understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.

Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes
and goals. EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions. EDA can help answer questions about standard 
deviations, categorical variables, and confidence intervals. Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can then be used 
for more sophisticated data analysis or modeling, including machine learning.
