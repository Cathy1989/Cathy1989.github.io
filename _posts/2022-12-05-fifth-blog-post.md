## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

Since I have learned several different powerful packages, I could use them instead of using some functions that come with R, like ggplot, tydiverse and caret.

And also, I can munipulate the raw data before I use it to summarize.

Last but not least, I will use loop to improve my R operation.


## Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? 

I am more interested in data science after I've had my course. I would like to do a data analysis job in the fashion field or Pharmaceutical industry.

It's so cool to anlyze massive data and make a prediction in the future.

## What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about? 

More knowledge about maching learning and SQL.
